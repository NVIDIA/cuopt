 * @brief A waypoint matrix.

 *
 * When the cost matrix is not acquirable due to an
 * incomplete graph, the latter can be passed to waypoint matrix.
 * The waypoint matrix can then return a cost matrix that can be used by the solver.
 *
 * The waypoint matrix can also generate the full path between target locations.
 * The full path represents the set of all vertices (with respect to the graph)
 * to go from one target location to another.

 * @tparam f_t Floating point type. float (32bit) is expected at the moment.
