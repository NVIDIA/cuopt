=========================
Third Party Solvers
=========================


--------------------------
AMPL Support
--------------------------

AMPL can be used with near zero code changes to switch to cuOpt as a solver to solve linear and quadratic programming problems.

.. note::

   AMPL is a commercial solver and requires a license to use. AMPL hasn't made a new release with cuOpt support yet.

--------------------------
PuLP Support
--------------------------

PuLP can be used with near zero code changes to switch to cuOpt as a solver to solve linear and quadratic programming problems.
Please refer to the `PuLP documentation <https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/>`_ for more information. And also refer to example notebook in the `cuopt-examples <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuopt-examples>`_ repository.
