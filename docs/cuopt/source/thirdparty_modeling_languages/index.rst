--------------------------
AMPL Support
--------------------------

AMPL can be used with near zero code changes: just switch to cuOpt as a solver to solve linear and mixed-integer programming problems. Please refer to the `AMPL documentation <https://www.ampl.com/>`_ for more information.

--------------------------
PuLP Support
--------------------------

PuLP can be used with near zero code changes: just switch to cuOpt as a solver to solve linear and mixed-integer programming problems.
Please refer to the `PuLP documentation <https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/>`_ for more information. Also, see the example notebook in the `cuopt-examples <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuopt-examples>`_ repository.
